    "In initial testing, I noticed that the C++ version, based on Deitel and Deitel's code, was *extremely* slow due to the use of C++11 `std::vector`s rather than C-style arrays. I researched how to parallelize code using C++11's `std::thread` API and the parallel merge sort routine in Cormen et al chapter 27, however the overhead of creating extra threads slowed the program even further and crashed sorting arrays of size $n = 2^{20}$. A better option would be to use `std::async` and futures to serially sort multiple vectors in parallel, but I was not able to grasp that API in time for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had read before that Google's Go language has native support for concurrency, and after a few hours with the Go tutorials I decided to attempt to reimplement the project in Go. Converting the non-parallelized C++ code was straightforward, and I was able to redo several days' worth of C++ work in a few hours in Go. Go's goroutines and channels make implementing concurrent code reasonably simple. Furthermore, operations on Go's built-in array slice data structure (based on C-style arrays) are much faster than C++ `std::vector`s. Serial `slice`-based Go code ran an order of magnitude faster than `std::vector`-based C++ code, and parallelizing the execution further cut run-times approximately in half."
