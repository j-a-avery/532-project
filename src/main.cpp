/******************************************************************************
 * 
 * James A. Avery
 * 50189091
 * CSCI 532 Semester Project
 * 
 * Problem #3 (expanded)
 * Write a C/C++/Matlab/Java program to compute insertion sort and merge sort.
 * (You can use the code from the textbooks by Deitel and Deitel or from the
 *  web.) 
 * Obtain the run time of both routines. 
 * The input data should be an int array containing random element values 
 *  (between, say, 0 and 1023). 
 * Obtain run time T with 1D (input) array size of n=16, 256, 4096, 65536, 
 *  1048576 (which equal 2^p, where p = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20).
 * The run time for each n should be average with about floor(512/(p*p)) runs.
 * Each run (for a given n) should use a different random input.
 * Plot (with Excel, Matlab, or other available tools) the run time for both
 *  routines on one plot, with the x axis in p values, and y axis in log(T).
 * Label on the plot which curve is for insertion sort and which is for merge
 *  sort.
 * Submit C/C++ programs and plot, with instructions in readme.txt on how to 
 *  build and run the program. (Include the Dev-C++ or MS Studio or Java
 *  NetBeans project file.)
